# FinalCapstone

# Below are selected projects from my HyperionDev Data Science Bootcamp, displaying my coding repertoire.

# Task 05 (Capstone Project) - finance_calculators.py:
# Created this programme, for a hypothetical finance company, which allows the user to access two different financial calculators (an investment calculator, and a home loan repayment calculator). This code utilises the Python math library, and offers a simple or compound investment calculator, or a bond repayment calculator based on specified parameters collected from the user via inputs.

# Task 07 (While Loops) - while.py:
# This programme invites user to enter as many numbers as they'd like; to break out of this loop, they enter -1. Upon doing so, the programme calculates the average of all the numbers entered (except for -1).

# Task 09 (Defensive Programming) - calculator.py:
# This programme creates a simple calculator application that invites the user to enter two numbers, and the operation (+, -, /, x) that they'd like to perform on the former. The answers to these programmes are then written to a text file; defensive programming here handles any unexpected events or user inputs. The programme is further extended by allowing the user to either use the calculator function, or to read all of the equations from a .txt file (taking the file name as an input from the reader) and printing out all of the equations, together with their results.

# Task 11 (Advanced String Handling) - alternative.py:
# The first part of this programme reads in a string and capitalises each alternate letter, keeping (or making) the other letter lowercase; the second part of the programme uses the same sentence, but instead makes each alternate word lowercase or uppercase.

# Task 12 (Lists and Dictionaries) - cafe.py:
# This programme uses 2D dictionaries to calculate the total stock worth of items within a cafe.

# Task 14 (Functions) - holiday.py:
# Using the user's selection of destination, this programme is designed to calculate the cost of a user's holiday (limited to the cost of flights, hotel and car rental) based on the aforementioned destination and how long they will be in the respective city for. Exception handling was used to ensure that the programme would not crash, should the user enter something that the programme cannot recognise.

# Task 17 (Datasets) - Datasets Compulsory Task - completed.ipynb:
# Involves using pandas to manipulate datasets and obtain specific values / a range of values
# (Part 2) - report.ipynb
#Â More complicated task which involves using pandas functions to make a report on given data.

# Task 19 (Simple Linear Regression) - linear_regression.ipynb
# Importing insurance.csv into the notebook, this programme uses relevant columns to determine how age affects insurance costs (by plotting a scatter plot, then using sklearn to fit a linear regression model to the data, making predictions, before finally making a scatter plot with a line of best fit).

# Task 20 (Natural Language Processing) - garden.py:
# Using garden path sentences to test spaCy, this programme tokenises various senteces and performs named entity recognition; using spacy.explain to outline label explanations, the bottom of the file contains a short commentary on the meaning of certain labels.

# Task 21 (Semantic Similarity) - watch_next.py;
# This programme predicts what is best for the user to watch next, based on the semantic similarity between a description of 'Planet Hulk' and that of various other movies.

# Task 23 (Preparing for Interviews) - challenge.py:
# This short task performs actions of either adding or removing prefixes/suffixes to certain words; this short challenge was completed as part of wider interview preparation.
